# -Gesture-Based-Computer-Controlling-Using-Arduino
In this project, we have successfully demonstrated how to control a computer using hand gestures with the help of an Arduino board. By using a combination of an ultrasonic sensor and a microcontroller, we were able to capture hand gestures and convert them into specific commands for the computer.
